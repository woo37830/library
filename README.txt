This is the repository for library.  It runs on barsoom
in /Library/Server/Web/Data/Sites/Default/library.
There is no need for rsync now.  All copies have CVS and go to the same
repository.  After any changes on a particular machine, do cvs add and cvs
commit.
The version on woo-laptop runs from /Library/WebServer/Documents/library
